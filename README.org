#+TITLE: ejrx-jekyll
A (less) very minimal Jekyll theme for (my) personal blog. 

This theme is a fork of @oneohthree's [[http://github.com/oneohthree/sudo-jekyll][sudo-jekyll]] theme.

All the differences are additions I made for some additional functionality.

* Key Differences
1. Added basic "search" feature using [[http://github.com/christianfei/Simple-Jekyll/Search][Simple Jekyll Search]]
2. Support for code highlighting with Pygments
3. MathJax is available on all post pages
4. "about" and "contact" links underneath the copyright
