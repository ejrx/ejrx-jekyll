Post pages include a reference to [MathJax](http://mathjax.org).

Two examples are included, below.

### From the MathJax documentation:

When $a \ne 0$, there are two solutions to $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ and they are $$x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}.$$

### The Lorenz Equations

$$\begin{align}
\dot{x} & = \sigma(y-x) \\
\dot{y} & = \rho x - y - xz \\
\dot{z} & = -\beta z + xy
\end{align}$$
