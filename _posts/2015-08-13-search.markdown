Basic search functionality is provided by Christian Fei's [Simple Jekyll Search](http://github.com/christian-fei/Simple-Jekyll-Search). On the homepage, users can search for posts by category and/or tags.

By default, full-text search is *not* enabled.
To enable full-text search, backup the original copy of `search.json` and rename the `search_fulltxt.json` file in the root of this repository to `search.json`.

On a Unix system, the commands would be:

{% highlight bash %}
mv search.json search.json.bak
mv search_fulltxt.json search.json
{% endhighlight %}

For more information on customizing the "search" functionality, see [the original repository](http://github.com/christian-fei/Simple-Jekyll-Search).
